Here's a list of some seminars and reading groups that might be of interest to students in the Statistics Department:

## Neyman Seminar

When: Wednesdays, 4-5pm
Where: 1011 Evans Hall

The Neyman seminar is the department's main Statistics seminar. It has a very broad scope, with topics ranging from applications of statistics to theory. The speakers are typically researchers from other universities, invited to speak at Berkeley. See https://statistics.berkeley.edu/research/seminars/neyman for the details of past and upcoming talks.


## Probability Seminar

When: Wednesdays, 3-4pm
Where: 1011 Evans Hall

The probability seminar is a weekly seminar co-sponsored by the Statistics and Mathematics departments featuring the latest research in pure and applied probability, as well as probabilistic work from related disciplines including computer science and operations research. The speakers are typically researchers from other universities, invited to speak at Berkeley. It also offers graduate students a friendly environment to present their research. See https://statistics.berkeley.edu/research/seminars/probability for the details of past and upcoming talks.


## Student Probability Seminar

When: Wednesdays, 11am-12pm
Where: 891 Evans Hall

The student probability seminar is a weekly seminar run and attended by graduate students in the Statistics and Mathematics deprartments. Each week, a student volunteers to give a talk following the seminar's theme of the semester. See https://mriganka.xyz/seminar for the details of past and upcoming talks.


## CLIMB Seminar (Center for the Theoretical Foundations of Learning, Inference, Information, Intelligence, Mathematics and Microeconomics at Berkeley)

When: Fridays, 2-3pm
Where: 310 Sutardja Dai Hall

The CLIMB seminar is a weekly seminar covering topics at the intersection of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and economics. See https://climb.berkeley.edu/seminars/ for the details of past and upcoming talks.


## BLISS Seminar (Berkeley Laboratory for Information and System Sciences)

When: Wednesdays, 11am-12pm
Where: 400 Cory Hall

The BLISS seminar is a weekly seminar run by the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. Talks at the seminar cover topics including but not limited to information and coding theory, signal processing, optimization, statistics, and control.
